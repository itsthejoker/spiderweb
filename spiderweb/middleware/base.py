    All middleware should inherit from this class and have the following
    (optional!) methods:

    process_response(self, request, resp) -> None
    on_error(self, request, e) -> Response
    post_process(self, request, resp) -> Response

    If `process_request` returns a HttpResponse, the request will be short-circuited
    and the response will be returned immediately. `process_response` will not be called.
