# routes

To have logic that your application can use, you must be able to route incoming requests from The Outside:tm: and properly get them to your code and back. There are three different ways to set up this up depending on what works best for your application, and all three can be used together (though this is probably a bad idea).

## `route()` Decorator

In this pattern, you'll create your server at the top of the file and assign it to an object (usually called `app`). Once it's created, you'll be able to use the `@app.route` decorator to assign routes. This is the pattern used by the quickstart app:

```python
from spiderweb import SpiderwebRouter
from spiderweb.response import HttpResponse

app = SpiderwebRouter()

@app.route("/")
def index(request):
    return HttpResponse("HELLO, WORLD!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.start()
```

The `@app.route()` decorator takes two arguments â€” one required, one optional. The first is the path that your view will be found under; all paths start from the server root (`"/"`). The second is `allowed_methods`, which allows you to limit (or expand) the HTTP methods used for calling your view. For example, you may want to specify that a form view takes in `GET` and `POST` requests:

```python
@app.route("/myform", allowed_methods=["GET", "POST"])
def form_view(request):
    ...
```
If `allowed_methods` isn't passed in, the defaults (`["POST", "GET", "PUT", "PATCH", "DELETE"]`) will be used.

The decorator pattern is recommended simply because it's familiar to many, and for small apps, it's hard to beat the simplicity.

## After Instantiation

Some folks prefer to manually assign routes after the server has been instantiated, perhaps because the route isn't actually determined until runtime. To do this, the built server object has a function you can use:

```python
from spiderweb import SpiderwebRouter
from spiderweb.response import HttpResponse

app = SpiderwebRouter()

def index(request):
    return HttpResponse("HELLO, WORLD!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # shown here with the optional `allowed_methods` arg
    app.add_route("/", index, allowed_methods=["GET"])
    app.start()
```
The `allowed_methods` argument, like with the `.route()` decorator, is optional. If it's not passed, the defaults will be used instead. 

## During Instantiation

The third and final way that you can assign routes is in a single block more akin to how Django handles it. This allows you to curate large numbers of routes and pass them all in at the same time with little fuss. Though it may be a little contrived here, you can see how this works in the following example:

```python
from spiderweb import SpiderwebRouter
from spiderweb.response import HttpResponse


def index(request):
    return HttpResponse("HELLO, WORLD!")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    app = SpiderwebRouter(
        routes=[
            ("/", index, {"allowed_methods": ["GET", "POST"]})
        ]
    )
    app.start()
```
To declare routes during instantiation, pass in a list of tuples, where each tuple consists of three things:

```
routes = [
    (path: str, function: Callable, args: dict),
    ...
]
```
The only two args that can be passed here are `allowed_methods` as discussed above and `csrf_exempt`, where the value is a boolean (presumably `True`, as it defaults to `False`). For example, if you had a view that took unverified `POST` requests, you might set it up like this:

```python
routes = [
    ("/submit", submit_view, {"allowed_methods": ["POST"], "csrf_exempt": True})
]
```
Note that passing in `csrf_exempt` is not listed on the other two methods, mostly because it doesn't really make sense for the other methods. Instead, they use a decorator to handle it, which can be found in [the docs for CSRF protection.](middleware/csrf.md?id=marking-views-as-csrf-exempt) You can also use the decorator in the same way for routes assigned in this manner, but when you have a large number of routes, being able to see all the attributes in one place is helpful.
